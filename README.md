This is a small semester-project we made, as IT-Technology Students at University College Nordjylland. 

It's written in C# and uses a relational MS-SQL. 

Look at the diagrams, if you wanna know how the program is structured. 
It's not very well written, and the naming is out of control. 

How ever, this was an exercise in 'Thinking a program' and documenting it. 
The naming-convention is awful. I should change that some time (or re-write it in Java for X-platform).
